# My Personal Site

From github's [Using Jekyll with Pages instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/):

> Jekyll is an active open source project, and is updated frequently. As the GitHub Pages server is updated, the software on your computer may become out of date, resulting in your site appearing different locally from how it looks when published on GitHub. To keep Jekyll up to date, you can run the command `bundle update`
